Full LLM Response:
I do not have access to any knowledge base, company documentation, or internal procedures regarding F5 load balancer configurations.  Therefore, I cannot provide specific instructions on configuring a new F5 load balancer for high availability within your organization's environment.  The following information is based on general industry best practices and my training data, and should not be considered a substitute for your company's specific documentation and procedures.

To achieve high availability with an F5 load balancer, you generally need to implement a redundant system. This typically involves at least two F5 units working together.  Key principles include:

* **Active-Passive Configuration:** One unit acts as the active load balancer, handling all traffic. The other unit remains passive, ready to take over if the active unit fails.  This requires a mechanism for failover, often involving heartbeat monitoring and a shared storage solution for configuration.

* **Active-Active Configuration:** Both units actively handle traffic, distributing the load between them. This provides higher capacity and resilience but requires more complex configuration and potentially more sophisticated traffic management techniques.

* **Redundant Network Infrastructure:**  The F5 units themselves need redundant network connections (multiple uplinks to the network) to prevent single points of failure.  This often involves using multiple switches and potentially redundant internet connections.

* **Shared Storage (Optional but Recommended):**  For easier configuration management and faster failover, a shared storage solution (like a SAN or NAS) can be used to store the load balancer's configuration. This ensures both units have identical configurations.

* **Health Monitoring:**  The load balancer needs to constantly monitor the health of the backend servers it's distributing traffic to.  If a server fails, the load balancer should automatically remove it from the pool.

To give you a complete and accurate answer tailored to your specific environment, I would need the following documentation:

* **Your company's F5 configuration standards and best practices:** This would detail the preferred architecture (active-passive, active-active), specific hardware models used, and any internal naming conventions.
* **Network diagrams:**  These are crucial to understand the existing network infrastructure and plan the integration of the F5 load balancers.
* **Existing F5 configurations (if any):**  This would provide a baseline for the new configuration and help ensure consistency.
* **Details of your backend servers:**  This includes their IP addresses, health check parameters, and any specific requirements for load balancing.
* **Security policies and requirements:**  This would dictate how the F5 load balancer should be secured and configured to meet your organization's security standards.


You should consult the following resources for more detailed information:

* **F5 Networks Official Documentation:** The F5 website provides extensive documentation, including configuration guides and best practices.
* **F5 Training Courses:**  F5 offers various training courses that can provide in-depth knowledge of their products.
* **Online Forums and Communities:**  Many online forums and communities dedicated to networking and F5 load balancers can offer assistance and troubleshooting advice.


Remember, this is general guidance only.  Always refer to your company's specific documentation and procedures before making any changes to your network infrastructure.  Improper configuration can lead to network outages.
